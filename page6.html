            This fan page is ran by Mirshod Sobirov. I have been an avid fan of FC Barcelona since I was 8 years old,
            and have not missed a single game in the last several years. I think what drew me to this club was their identity and the way they want to play
            football. I am drawn to their attacking style of play and their goal to entertain the crowd with good football in addition to results.
            So far, I have attended one FC Barcelona game (friendly) back in 2019. I hope to one day visit the Camp Nou and watch a game there. 
            I am currently a Computer Science student at Wayne State University and created this website to showcase my skills at html.
